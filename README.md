# Handle based door stop

Created this to help solve the issue of my doors hitting walls in my house.

The idea being that I have an object that can be adjusted to fit around any door handle, allow for the object to hit
wall and cause less damage.

## TODO

* Make the object parametric
* Allow for different shaped handles
* Connecting part should be flexible and not solid
